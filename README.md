## 🧠 Executive Summary

In today’s competitive data-driven job market, understanding which skills command higher pay and how geography impacts salaries is crucial for both professionals and hiring teams.
To uncover these insights, I analyzed a real-world dataset of 2023 data-related job postings, identifying patterns between job titles, salaries, skills, and regions using Excel’s advanced analytics tools (Power Query, Power Pivot, DAX, and Pivot Charts).

This project delivers a data-backed salary intelligence dashboard that empowers stakeholders to:

- Benchmark compensation trends,

- Identify high-value technical skills, and

- Strategically invest in workforce upskilling.

💡 **Key Impact:** Revealed that professionals with 5+ in-demand skills (like Python, SQL, and Cloud tools) earn up to 32% higher salaries on average.

## 💼 Business Problem

Recruiters, HR leaders, and job seekers lack a data-driven view of the data science job market — particularly how skillsets, geography, and job titles affect compensation.
Without this transparency, companies risk underpaying or overpaying talent, while professionals may miss opportunities to upskill strategically for better pay.

Goal:
To analyze and visualize the 2023 Data Jobs market to answer:

This project was designed to answer key questions:

- Do more skills lead to better pay?

- Which skills are most in-demand and most valuable?

- Which skills and roles command the highest pay?

- What’s the salary range for the top 10 skills globally?

## 🔍 Methodology

Using **Excel’s Data Analytics Ecosystem**, I performed a full data analysis workflow:

- ** Data Preparation (ETL):** Cleaned and transformed job postings data using Power Query — removing inconsistencies, normalizing text, and structuring columns.

- **Data Modeling:** Built relational connections between data_jobs_all and data_job_skills using Power Pivot.

- **DAX Calculations:** Computed median salary measures across roles and countries.

- **Pivot & Visualization:** Designed interactive dashboards to visualize correlations between skills, salary, and geography.

### Why Excel?
To demonstrate that even with Excel, one can execute business-grade analytics — blending simplicity with analytical depth.
